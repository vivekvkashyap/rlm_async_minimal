I received a lot of requests to put out a notebook or gist version of the codebase I've been using. Sadly it's a bit entangled with a bunch of random state, cost, and code execution tracking logic that I want to clean up while I run other experiments. In the meantime, I've re-written a simpler version of what I'm using so people can get started building on top and writing their own RLM implementations. Happy hacking!

I've provided a basic, minimal implementation of a recursive language model (RLM) with a REPL environment for OpenAI clients. Like the blogpost, we only implement recursive sub-calls with `depth=1` inside the RLM environment. Enabling further depths is as simple as replacing the `Sub_RLM` class with the `RLM_REPL` class, but you may need to finagle the `exec`-based REPL environments to work better here (because now your sub-RLMs have their own REPL environments!).

In this stripped implementation, we exclude a lot of the logging, cost tracking, prompting, and REPL execution details of the experiments run in the blogpost. It's relatively easy to modify and build on top of this code to reproduce those results, but it's currently harder to go from my full codebase to supporting any new functionality.

## ⚡ NEW: Async Batch Processing

This implementation now supports **parallel batch processing** for sub-LLM calls! When the RLM needs to process multiple chunks or queries, it can now do so in parallel instead of sequentially, providing significant speedups.

**Key Features:**
- `llm_batch(prompts: List[str]) -> List[str]` function available in REPL environment
- Automatic parallel execution using `asyncio`
- Configurable concurrency limits for rate limiting
- Fully backward compatible with existing code

**Performance Example:**
```python
# Sequential (OLD) - ~6 seconds for 3 calls
for chunk in chunks:
    result = llm_query(f"Analyze: {chunk}")

# Parallel (NEW) - ~2 seconds for 3 calls
prompts = [f"Analyze: {chunk}" for chunk in chunks]
results = llm_batch(prompts)  # 3x faster!
```

See [ASYNC_BATCH_GUIDE.md](docs/ASYNC_BATCH_GUIDE.md) for detailed documentation and examples.

## Basic Example
We have all the basic dependencies in `requirements.txt`, although none are really necessary if you change your implementation (`openai` for LM API calls, `python-dotenv` for .env loading, and `rich` for logging).

In `main.py`, we have a basic needle-in-the-haystack (NIAH) example that embeds a random number inside ~1M lines of random words, and asks the model to go find it. It's a silly Hello World type example to emphasize that `RLM.completion()` calls are meant to replace `LM.completion()` calls.

To see the new batch processing in action, run:
```bash
python extra/example_batch.py
```

## Code Structure
In the `rlm/` folder, the two main files are `rlm_repl.py` and `repl.py`. 
* `rlm_repl.py` offers a basic implementation of an RLM using a REPL environment in the `RLM_REPL` class. The `completion()` function gets called when we query an RLM.
* `repl.py` is a simple `exec`-based implementation of a REPL environment that adds an LM sub-call function. To make the system truly recursive beyond `depth=1`, you can replace the `Sub_RLM` class with `RLM_REPL` (they all inherit from the `RLM` base class).

The functionality for parsing and handling base LLM clients are all in `rlm/utils/`. We also add example prompts here.

> The `rlm/logger/` folder mainly contains optional logging utilities used by the RLM REPL implementation. If you want to enable colorful or enhanced logging outputs, you may need to install the [`rich`](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) library as a dependency.
```
pip install rich
```

When you run your code, you'll see something like this:
