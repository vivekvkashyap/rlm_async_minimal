[1mINITIAL MESSAGES SETUP - [Root LLM | depth=0/2 | iter=0/5]:[0m
  [33m[1] SYSTEM:[0m You are tasked with answering a query with associated context. You can access, transform, and analyze this context interactively in a REPL environment that can recursively query sub-LLMs, which you are strongly encouraged to use as much as possible. You will be queried iteratively until you provide a final answer.

The REPL environment is initialized with:
1. A `context` variable that contains extremely important information about your query. You should check the content of the `context` variable to understand what you are working with. Make sure you look through it sufficiently as you answer your query.
2. A `llm_query(prompt: str) -> str` function that allows you to query an LLM (that can handle around 500K chars) inside your REPL environment.
3. A `llm_batch(prompts: List[str], max_concurrent: int = 10) -> List[str]` function that allows you to query the LLM with MULTIPLE prompts in PARALLEL. This is much faster than calling llm_query in a loop. Use this whenever you need to process multiple chunks or queries.
4. The ability to use `print()` statements to view the output of your REPL code and continue your reasoning.

**RECURSION INFO**: You are the ROOT LLM (depth 0). Your sub-LLMs (called via llm_query/llm_batch) also have their own REPL environments and can spawn further sub-LLMs! This means you can delegate complex sub-tasks that require code execution and analysis to your sub-LLMs. Current max_depth is 2.

You will only be able to see truncated outputs from the REPL environment, so you should use the query LLM function on variables you want to analyze. You will find this function especially useful when you have to analyze the semantics of the context. Use these variables as buffers to build up your final answer.
Make sure to explicitly look through the entire context in REPL before answering your query. An example strategy is to first look at the context and figure out a chunking strategy, then break up the context into smart chunks, and query an LLM per chu...

[Root LLM] Response: I will analyze each research area in the context separately. I'll create prompts to extract key themes and main technologies from each area, and then I will synthesize how these areas can work together in a modern application.

Here's my plan:
1. Split the context into three distinct prompts based on the three areas: Machine Learning, Distributed Systems, and Security.
2. Use `llm_batch()` to analyze these prompts in parallel, gathering insights on the key themes and technologies for each area.
3. Finally, I'll synthesize these findings to illustrate how they can work together.

Let's start by creating the prompts for analysis.

[Root LLM] Response: I will begin synthesizing the findings based on the analysis results obtained for each research area (Machine Learning, Distributed Systems, and Security). I will create prompts summarizing the key themes and technologies for these areas and generate connections on how they can work together in a modern application. This will involve querying sub-LLMs for clarity and insights.

First, let's outline the synthesis process:

1. **Extract key themes and technologies** from the completed analysis results for each area.
2. **Identify commonalities** or potential synergies between these areas.
3. **Synthesize** how they can be integrated into a modern application.

I'll start by analyzing the `analysis_results` to gather the findings for each area. I will create a structured overview for each area followed by a synthesis prompt.

Here's the next action for synthesizing the findings:

```repl

[Root LLM] Response: I need to break down the task into manageable steps using the REPL environment. The goal is to analyze each research area (Machine Learning, Distributed Systems, Security) using sub-LLMs and then synthesize the findings based on those analyses. 

Here is the planned approach:

1. **Analyze Each Area**: Use sub-LLMs to extract key themes and main technologies from the context for each of the three areas.
2. **Synthesize Findings**: Compile the analyses into a final synthesis that highlights how these areas interrelate in a modern application.

Let's start by querying the LLM in parallel for each research area analysis.

### Step 1: Analyze Machine Learning, Distributed Systems, and Security
I'll create the prompts for each area based on the context and then invoke the LLM to perform the analysis.

```repl
# Preparing prompts for each research area analysis
analysis_prompts = [
    "Analyze the following research area: Machine Learning. Identify the key themes and main technologies mentioned.",
    "Analyze the following research area: Distributed Systems. Identify the key themes and main technologies mentioned.",
    "Analyze the following research area: Security. Identify the key themes and main technologies mentioned."
]

# Querying the LLM in parallel to get analyses for all areas
analysis_results = llm_batch(analysis_prompts)
```

Let's execute this code to gather the analyses for each area.
